## Application Security Project – Control-Flow Hijacking

Developed exploits in a controlled Linux VM environment to analyze and exploit stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in native C programs.

**Key Concepts Explored**
- Stack variable and return address overwrites
- Redirecting execution to injected shellcode
- Indirect control-flow hijacking under constrained input
- Bypassing DEP using return-to-libc and ROP techniques
- Exploiting targets with randomized stack positions (ASLR considerations)

**Technical Stack**
- C 
- Python 
- x86_64 assembly analysis
- GDB for dynamic debugging
- ROPgadget for gadget discovery
- Linux VM environment
